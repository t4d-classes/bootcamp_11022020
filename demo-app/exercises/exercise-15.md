# Exercise 15

1. Add a "Clear" button. When the button is clicked, clear the history, set the result and num input to zero.

2. For each history entry, display a delete button. When the button is clicked remove the entry from the history. Do not update the result.

3. If the user attempts to divide by zero, display an error message at the top of the calc tool. PLEASE DO NOT USE WINDOW.ALERT to display the error message. Do not add the operation to the history, and do not change the result.
